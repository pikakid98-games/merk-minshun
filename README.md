> [!NOTE]
> This repo does NOT include any preset code or assets from RPG Maker VX Ace. Only new code made specifically for/or used in the game. Meaning that I downloaded it from somewhere. I hopefully gave credit. To work around this, Simply create a blank project with RPG Maker VX Ace and decompile the code and drop it in.. It should be identical.. And if not, then it should be similar enough to not break everything

# Merk Minshun
A version of my old Markiplier's Mansion fangame, but now with an extra twist. The game now takes place in a stupid gameshow called Girl Or Trap (Shut up)
